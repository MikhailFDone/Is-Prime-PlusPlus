# Is-Prime-PlusPlus

**This project is inspired by [Is-Prime](https://github.com/mawerty/Is-Prime)**

Welcome to the GitHub repository of an efficient algorithm that determines whether or not a given number is prime, with 100% accuracy in constant time (O(1)). Prime numbers have always been an interesting topic in the field of mathematics and computer science, and detecting them with high accuracy and efficiency is a challenge that has been tackled by many researchers.

## FAQ
### Is this project serious?
Yes, this is a 100% serious project.

###Where where does 100% come from?
While Is-Prime is working with integer between 1 and 2,147,483,647, Is-Prime-PlusPlus is working with integers up to 4,294,967,295 and knows exactly if number is prime (but uses about 170MB of memory).
